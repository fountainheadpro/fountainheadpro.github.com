I'm not claiming to be an expert in digital marketing or, how it it now called, **growth hacking**.
It's just the act of posting something online, leaving it there and getting people to do something without human attention was always facinating to me. 
This post is more a geek reflection on the lesseons learned so far. 

While everybody talking about **call for action** rule, in reality, the visitor of a landing page has three distinct taksk to perform, which are:

* This will become a table of contents (this text will be scraped).

# Learn

Before your visitors will do anytihing, they need to learn your proposition. 
Educating, by it self, is a challenging task. People attention span is measured in sceonds.
What can be done to better utlize this attention span and get people to **learn**?

* **Establish the context**:
User experience needs to match the experience of the place they are coming from.
Make that mind excersie and forget about your passion for the product and your goals. The user, who will browse to your page does not care about all of that.  Get in the mind of the user, who just opened that annoying email, was doing google search or was looking at kittens pictures on facebook.
Your landing page shoudl be contnuation of this experience.

* **Write to ephesize the benefit.**:
Your writing should be minimal and project the **benefit** the visitor will get.
Focus on the **benefit**, not the **action** your want them perform.
Are you building a landing page for google ad, email or youtube ad campaign?
Try to match the words in the ad or email to make the visitor feel like they are in the right place.

* **Tap to human imagination**:
If you are thinking about educting visitors about your product in one or two sentences, do not, it's impossible.
Your background and images need to trigger the emotions of exporation and curiosity, which will get them to contibue.

#Trust

Here are quick ways to build trust:

* **Social Proof:** If your brand is not yet regnizable by many, try to establish social proof by showing the commitment others made towards business relationship with you. 

	Here are some  points, which can be helpful:
	* Testimonials from you customers
	* Endorsements 
	* Informaiton about your team

* **Established Business:** Your landing needs to reflect the strnegth of the business behind it.
Nobody wants to invest their pressions time and attention looking at the products by the unknown.

	You need to post information about your business:
	* Brand
	* Business name
	* Address
	* Phone number
	* Contact email

	***Tip***: When postng your phone/email address information, post it as an image, not as text.
	Post it as text and expect calls from vendors, who used robots to scrape sites like yours.

Keep in mind that your **social proof** and the **business informaiton** competes with the main call for action.
Most of this informaiton should be on the bottom of the page or below the fold.

#Commit
It can be sign up for email list, fill the survey, sign the petition, watch the video or just click on the link. 
All previous development ultimately brings to the action, but to perform the action, your visitor needs to mentally **commit** to doing this. Since this commitment can be very short term, your window opportunity is minimal.

Here are few tips:
* **Think eye flow:** People mentally follow natural order of reading. Allocate right and top portions of your sreen to <a href="#Learn">Learn</a> and **left and bottom** parts to Commit.
* **Grab attention** Your main action link or signup form needs to have bright points, which grab the attention.
* **Reflect** Make sure that the button or form has visual feedback in place, which demonstrates that this is where the action needs to be prformed.
